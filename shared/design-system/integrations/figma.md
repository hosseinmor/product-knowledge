# Figma Reference

Figma is the live source for **current editable visual construction**: component anatomy, variants/properties, Variables, Styles, spacing/layout construction, and the current design asset itself.

It does not own semantic usage rules, Product business behavior, runtime API names, or generated package syntax.

## Current library source

Primary Design System file:

- File: `-DS--Job-Vision-NEXT`
- File key: `rROD8ctH9UfPGAMrRrOzHe`
- URL: https://www.figma.com/design/rROD8ctH9UfPGAMrRrOzHe/-DS--Job-Vision-NEXT

Use the live file for exact visual facts instead of copying changing values into Markdown.

## Current variable architecture

Verified from the live file on 2026-09-16:

| Collection | Modes | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `01 Primitives` | `Value` | raw Color authoring palette; not Product-facing API |
| `02 Product` | `JobVision / Cando` | Figma Product selector; routes Product-aware typography and Semantic Color |
| `03 Semantic` | `Value` | stable public Semantic Color contract |
| `03 Semantic Values` | `Light / Dark` | Product-nested implementation values for the public Semantic contract |
| `04 Component Tokens` | `Light / Dark` | private component-owned values; currently categorical Tag |
| `Spacing` | `Mode 1` | shared spacing values |
| `Radius` | `Mode 1` | shared radius roles/values |
| `Typography breakpoint` | `LG / SM` | design-time Fluid Heading resolution |
| `Responsive layout` | `Value` | breakpoint/container/padding foundation values |

The Color routing model is:

```text
01 Primitives
      ↓
03 Semantic Values
  Light | Dark
  ├── jobvision/*
  └── cando/*
      ↑
02 Product
 JobVision | Cando
      ↓
03 Semantic
 stable public contract
```

`02 Product` and `03 Semantic Values` are authoring implementation layers. Runtime Theme packages do not need to reproduce this routing graph.

Only the stable Semantic contract should be treated as the normal Product-facing Color API. Collection visibility in Figma does not redefine that API boundary.

## Theme and Product representation

The current Figma model preserves independent selectors:

- **Product** → `02 Product: JobVision | Cando`
- **Appearance** → `03 Semantic Values: Light | Dark`

Switching Product changes the Product branch used by the public Semantic contract and the Product-aware font family. Switching Appearance resolves Light/Dark values independently.

`04 Component Tokens` is Product-independent in the current contract and varies only by Appearance.

## Stable component identity example: Button

Verified design identity:

- Component set: `Button / Default`
- Node ID: `1854:1776`
- Component key: `be5d0d9cd5fdd02f9d7afa1e371c2f2a23acb329`

Use the live Figma component for current variants, properties, anatomy, and visual construction. Do not copy its full property matrix into this reference because that information changes during component pilots.

These are **design identifiers**. Do not infer runtime component names, props, or shipped support until the Code mapping is registered.

## Figma → code mapping

Mapping status is tracked in `component-mapping.md`.

Current rule:

- Figma component key / node ID identifies the design asset.
- Code repository/package/component and prop mapping must come from the real implementation source.
- Storybook story IDs/URLs must come from the real Storybook source.
- Do not invent code names from Figma page/component/property names.
- Code Connect may become the mapping mechanism, but no Code Connect contract is currently registered.

## AI retrieval rule

```text
semantic meaning / usage
→ Design System Knowledge

current visual value / anatomy / property / binding
→ live Figma file

runtime prop / default / behavior
→ registered Code source

runnable state / interaction / accessibility evidence
→ registered Storybook/test source
```

If the required live source is unavailable, report the integration gap rather than substituting a Markdown guess.

## Known gaps

- runtime Design System repository/package is not yet registered;
- Storybook is not yet registered;
- Figma ↔ code prop mapping is not yet verified;
- per-component published-library status should be inspected live when needed rather than inferred from this document.
