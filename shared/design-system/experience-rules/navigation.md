# Navigation

## Link Versus Button

Semantics are independent from visual appearance.

- An action that changes state or performs an operation uses a native Button.
- An action that navigates to another destination uses a native Link.

A Link may use Button visual styling while retaining Link semantics and accessibility behavior.

“Read more” and “View all” may appear as text links or Button-styled links depending on context. Their destination determines semantics; appearance does not.

## Flow Navigation Terms

Back, Cancel, Close, and Exit have different meanings. Their detailed behavior in multi-step flows is documented in `../patterns/multi-step-flow.md`.
