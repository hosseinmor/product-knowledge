# Jobvision Color Tokens v3 — Surface Model

> Status: Working draft  
> Theme scope: Light + Dark  
> Implementation target: Tailwind CSS v3  
> CSS variables: Open decision  
> Product variation: Brand override only  
> Experience variation: Productive / Expressive

## Architecture

```text
Primitives
→ Brand
→ Experience
→ Semantic
→ Component
```

Collections and modes:

```text
01 Primitives
- Value

02 Brand
- Jobvision
- Cando

03 Experience
- Productive
- Expressive

04 Semantic
- Light
- Dark

05 Component
- Light
- Dark
```

Approved color-token inventory:

| Collection | Variables |
|---|---:|
| `02 Brand` | 12 |
| `03 Experience` | 2 |
| `04 Semantic` | 89 |
| `05 Component` | 20 |

The Primitive count is intentionally not fixed by this catalog.

Components consume Semantic tokens by default. Approved component-specific families, currently Tag, are exposed through Component tokens. Figma variable names use slash grouping; code flattens `/` to `-`.

The complete mode-by-mode value graph is defined in `color-token-aliases.md`. This catalog remains the source of truth for token meaning and usage.

---

## Naming decision

All UI backgrounds above `canvas` use the unified `surface-*` family.

Deprecated:

```text
bg-*
fill-*
```

Current:

```text
canvas
surface-*
```

`canvas` remains unprefixed because it is the root page or workspace background.

---

## Primitives

Primitive variables contain raw values only:

```text
color/neutral/*
color/blue/*
color/purple/*
color/red/*
color/green/*
color/emerald/*
color/orange/*
color/yellow/*
color/black-alpha/*
color/white-alpha/*
color/brand/jobvision/*
color/brand/cando/*
```

Rules:

- One mode: `Value`
- Direct values only
- No Light/Dark roles
- No Productive/Expressive roles
- No semantic UI roles

---

## Brand

Modes:

```text
Jobvision
Cando
```

Initial variables:

```text
accent/50
accent/100
accent/200
accent/300
accent/400
accent/500
accent/600
accent/700
accent/800
accent/900
accent/950

content/on-accent
```

All Brand values alias Primitive variables.

Example:

```text
Brand/accent/500

Jobvision → Primitives/color/brand/jobvision/500
Cando     → Primitives/color/brand/cando/500
```

```text
Brand/content/on-accent

Jobvision → Primitives/color/neutral/0
Cando     → Primitives/color/neutral/950
```

No Brand-level `focus` variable is currently defined. Focus remains Semantic and brand-independent until a real brand-specific treatment is approved.

Do not put these in Brand:

```text
surface-brand-emphasis
fg-on-brand
line-brand
canvas
selected
```

---

## Experience

Modes:

```text
Productive
Expressive
```

### Productive

For focused, operational, repetitive, management-oriented experiences such as employer panels, ATS, onboarding, and workflow-heavy tools.

### Expressive

For discovery, browsing, editorial, marketing, and visually prominent experiences such as jobseeker, job pages, company pages, and landing pages.

Initial variables:

```text
canvas/light
canvas/dark
```

Example mappings:

```text
Experience/canvas/light

Productive → Primitives/color/neutral/50
Expressive → Primitives/color/neutral/0
```

```text
Experience/canvas/dark

Productive → Primitives/color/neutral/950
Expressive → Primitives/color/neutral/900
```

These are the current Experience alias mappings. The complete resolution graph is defined in `color-token-aliases.md`.

In the current version, Experience controls environment-level surface decisions such as canvas. It may later expand to typography strategy, density, layout rhythm, or selected component treatments.

---

## Semantic

Modes:

```text
Light
Dark
```

### Canvas

```text
canvas

Light → Experience/canvas/light
Dark  → Experience/canvas/dark
```

Use for root page or workspace background only.

---

## Unified surface family

### Base surfaces

```text
surface-default
surface-inset
surface-muted
surface-inverse
```

- `surface-default`: normal container, card, panel, sheet, modal, or popover
- `surface-inset`: nested recessed region
- `surface-muted`: passive supporting or grouping region
- `surface-inverse`: high-contrast inverted region

`surface-muted` is non-interactive and has no hover or active states.

### Interactive neutral surface

```text
surface-control
surface-control-hover
surface-control-active
```

Use for neutral controls with a visible background at rest, including Secondary Button, neutral filled Icon Button, Filter Chip, and Segmented Control.

### Neutral emphasis surface

```text
surface-emphasis
surface-emphasis-hover
surface-emphasis-active
```

Use for high-emphasis neutral actions such as Primary Button.

Foreground:

```text
fg-on-color
```

### Transparent interaction states

```text
surface-transparent-hover
surface-transparent-active
surface-transparent-inverse-hover
surface-transparent-inverse-active
```

Use `surface-transparent-hover/active` when rest is transparent on normal surfaces, such as Tertiary, Ghost, toolbar actions, and lightweight icon controls.

Use `surface-transparent-inverse-hover/active` for the same interaction on `surface-inverse`.

### Brand surfaces

```text
surface-brand-muted
surface-brand-emphasis
surface-brand-emphasis-hover
surface-brand-emphasis-active
```

Example:

```text
surface-brand-emphasis
Light → Brand/accent/600
Dark  → Brand/accent/600
```

Foreground:

```text
fg-on-brand → Brand/content/on-accent
```

### Magic surfaces

```text
surface-magic-muted
surface-magic-emphasis
surface-magic-emphasis-hover
surface-magic-emphasis-active
```

Magic is reserved for AI-assisted, generated, or explicitly magical product experiences. It must not replace Brand, Selected, or Support meaning.

### Selected surfaces

```text
surface-selected-muted
surface-selected-muted-hover
surface-selected-muted-active

surface-selected-emphasis
surface-selected-emphasis-hover
surface-selected-emphasis-active

surface-selected-disabled

surface-selected-inverse
surface-selected-inverse-hover
surface-selected-inverse-active
```

Use `surface-selected-disabled` when a selected control becomes disabled. Use the inverse family when selection appears on `surface-inverse`.

Foreground:

```text
fg-on-color
fg-on-color-disabled
```

Brand and selected remain separate semantic roles even when they share a foreground token.

### Disabled surface

```text
surface-disabled
```

Disabled state has no hover or active state.

### Danger surfaces

```text
surface-danger-muted
surface-danger-emphasis
surface-danger-emphasis-hover
surface-danger-emphasis-active
```

Danger is for destructive actions. Error is for validation or system conditions.

### Support surfaces

```text
surface-info-muted
surface-success-muted
surface-warning-muted
surface-error-muted
```

The `muted` segment is explicit because these tokens are low-emphasis Support backgrounds, not filled actions.

Matching roles:

```text
fg-info
fg-success
fg-warning
fg-error

line-info
line-success
line-warning
line-error
```

---

## Foreground

```text
fg-primary
fg-secondary
fg-tertiary
fg-placeholder
fg-disabled

fg-on-inverse
fg-on-brand
fg-on-color
fg-on-color-disabled

fg-brand
fg-magic
fg-danger

fg-info
fg-success
fg-warning
fg-error

fg-info-inverse
fg-success-inverse
fg-warning-inverse
fg-error-inverse
```

Rules:

- `fg-tertiary` is the lowest general-purpose text/icon emphasis. Do not restore `fg-subtle`.
- `fg-placeholder` is a distinct input role and must not be substituted with `fg-tertiary`.
- `fg-on-inverse` is neutral content on `surface-inverse`.
- `fg-on-brand` is brand-dependent; Cando may use a dark foreground on yellow brand surfaces.
- `fg-on-color` is shared content on strong neutral, danger, magic, or selected color surfaces.
- `fg-on-color-disabled` is the disabled counterpart for content that remains on a colored or selected surface.
- `fg/*-inverse` is colored Support content on a neutral inverse surface; it is not a replacement for `fg-on-color`.

Deprecated:

```text
fg-subtle      → fg-tertiary
fg-inverse     → fg-on-inverse
fg-on-color → fg-on-color
fg-on-color → fg-on-color
fg-on-fill     → role-specific foreground
fg-on-primary  → fg-on-color
```

---

## Link

Figma variables:

```text
link/default
link/hover
link/visited
link/emphasis
link/emphasis-hover
link/inverse
link/inverse-hover
```

Flattened code names:

```text
link-default
link-hover
link-visited
link-emphasis
link-emphasis-hover
link-inverse
link-inverse-hover
```

There are two link roles:

- `default`: the normal neutral link. Its affordance comes from underline, placement, or context rather than brand color.
- `emphasis`: a higher-emphasis, product-specific link. It must not alias `fg-brand` directly because Cando's yellow accent is not a suitable link text color.

`visited` is the persistent state for a previously opened destination. It replaces the incorrectly named `active`; pressed interaction must not use the visited token.

`inverse` adapts the default link for use on `surface-inverse` and is not a third link role. Interactive inverse links use `link/inverse-hover` on hover.

The Link variables are recorded in `color-token-aliases.md`; their unresolved Alias values remain marked `TBD` pending the approved Figma Alias export and contrast testing.

---

## Line

```text
line-muted
line-default
line-emphasis
line-disabled
line-inverse

line-brand
line-selected
line-magic
line-danger

line-info
line-success
line-warning
line-error
```

Use `line-*` instead of `border-*` to avoid conflict with Tailwind utilities.

Deprecated:

```text
line-subtle → line-muted
line-strong → line-emphasis
```

---

## Focus

```text
focus-default
focus-inverse
```

Rules:

- Independent from component tone
- Visible across supported surfaces
- Cando yellow must not be the sole focus indicator
- Single-layer by default; dual-layer media focus remains an open decision

Deprecated:

```text
focus
focus-ring
```

---

## Utility

These roles live in `04 Semantic`, outside the Surface family.

### Highlight

```text
highlight-default
highlight-inverse
```

Use for matched text, search results, or temporary textual emphasis. Do not use Highlight for Warning or Selected state.

### Overlay

```text
overlay-default
```

Use for modal, sheet, and dialog backdrops. No separate `scrim` role is approved in v3.

### Skeleton

```text
skeleton-base
skeleton-shimmer
```

`skeleton-base` is the stable body. `skeleton-shimmer` is the moving highlight layer.

---

## Component tokens

Modes:

```text
Light
Dark
```

Component tokens are exceptional, component-owned roles. They may alias Semantic tokens or, when no shared semantic role exists, approved Primitive tokens. Components continue to use Semantic tokens unless an approved component family is documented here and in `component-tokens.md`.

### Tag

Tag colors communicate grouping or categorization, not feedback status. The approved variants are:

```text
neutral
blue
purple
green
orange
```

Each variant provides:

```text
tag-surface-{variant}
tag-surface-{variant}-hover
tag-fg-{variant}
tag-line-{variant}
```

Example:

```text
tag-surface-blue
tag-surface-blue-hover
tag-fg-blue
tag-line-blue
```

Figma variables use slash grouping inside the `05 Component` collection:

```text
tag/surface/blue
tag/surface/blue-hover
tag/fg/blue
tag/line/blue
```

The flattened code names remain `tag-surface-blue`, `tag-surface-blue-hover`, `tag-fg-blue`, and `tag-line-blue`.

Current Light mappings, carried forward from the v2 categorical family:

| Variant | Surface | Hover | Foreground | Line |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Neutral | `color/neutral/100` | `color/neutral/200` | `color/neutral/700` | `color/neutral/200` |
| Blue | `color/blue/50` | `color/blue/100` | `color/blue/700` | `color/blue/200` |
| Purple | `color/purple/50` | `color/purple/100` | `color/purple/700` | `color/purple/200` |
| Green | `color/emerald/50` | `color/emerald/100` | `color/emerald/700` | `color/emerald/200` |
| Orange | `color/orange/50` | `color/orange/100` | `color/orange/700` | `color/orange/200` |

Rules:

- Only interactive Tags use `tag-surface-{variant}-hover`.
- Static Tags, labels, and metadata markers do not show hover treatment.
- Tag colors must not communicate information, success, warning, or error. Use the matching Semantic support tokens for feedback status.
- Tag tokens are owned by the Tag component and must not be reused as a general categorical palette by unrelated components.
- Light and Dark alias mappings are defined in `color-token-aliases.md`.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ghost | transparent | `surface-transparent-hover` | `surface-transparent-active` | `fg-primary` |
| Danger Ghost | transparent | `surface-transparent-hover` | `surface-transparent-active` | `fg-danger` |

## Open decisions

1. Final opaque Primitive scale values
2. CSS variables adoption
3. Tailwind v3 implementation mapping
4. Dual-layer focus treatment for media
5. Whether Experience expands beyond canvas in the first implementation
6. Final unresolved Alias values, especially Link and `fg-on-color-disabled`
7. Accessibility approval of the current alias mappings before promotion from working draft to stable
