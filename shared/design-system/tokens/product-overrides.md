# Product and Theme Selection

## Scope

Product identity and Theme are separate concepts.

```text
Product / application
→ selects a compatible Theme package

Theme package
→ supplies visual token values

Appearance
→ selects Light or Dark values within that Theme
```

Current intended selection:

```text
JobVision → JobVision Theme
Cando     → Cando Theme
```

This current mapping does not make Product a permanent Theme dimension. A future Product may reuse a Theme or a deployment may select another compatible Theme.

## Color identity

Brand semantics remain part of the shared Semantic API:

```text
surface/brand
surface/brand-hover
surface/brand-active
fg/on-brand
```

Their values are Theme-owned.

Conceptually:

```text
JobVision Theme
  surface/brand        → JobVision-local Blue value
  surface/brand-hover  → JobVision-local Blue hover value
  surface/brand-active → JobVision-local Blue active value
  fg/on-brand          → JobVision-local on-Brand value

Cando Theme
  surface/brand        → Cando-local Yellow value
  surface/brand-hover  → Cando-local Yellow hover value
  surface/brand-active → Cando-local Yellow active value
  fg/on-brand          → Cando-local on-Brand value
```

A separate runtime `Brand` alias layer is not required.

## Accent remains independent from Brand

Brand means Product identity or approved Product-defining moments. Accent means general chromatic interaction/affordance.

A Theme may currently map both roles to similar hues or different hues without merging their meaning.

For example, Cando may resolve Brand from Yellow while Accent remains Blue.

## Appearance

Each Theme package contains both Light and Dark Semantic value sets.

```text
Installed Theme
├── Light
└── Dark
```

Appearance may change at runtime without changing the installed Theme package.

## Product code constraint

Product code consumes shared Design System contracts. It must not:

- branch on Product merely to choose a DS color;
- consume Theme-local Primitives;
- assume a specific Theme Primitive name/value;
- encode Product names into shared Semantic token names.

Product-specific business behavior may still depend on Product identity; this document governs visual token resolution only.

## Current Figma transition

The existing Figma model still represents Product variation through `02 Brand → JobVision | Cando`. This is transitional authoring structure, not the target runtime package model.

Figma migration is intentionally deferred until the categorical Tag/component Theme boundary is finalized.
