# Component Tokens

## Purpose

Component Color tokens are exceptions. Create them only when a stable component-owned contract cannot be expressed clearly through shared Semantic Color roles.

Other foundations may define component-owned geometry or motion tokens under their own contracts; they are not required to follow the Color graph.

## Default rule

Most components consume Semantic Color directly:

```text
Theme-local Primitive → Semantic → Product UI / Component
```

A private Component token may alias a Semantic role when that indirection adds useful component-owned meaning, but Theme packages should not need to know about ordinary component anatomy.

Do not insert a Component-token layer merely to rename an existing Semantic token.

For example, Button presets map directly to Semantic roles. Button does not need its own Color-token family.

## When a Component Color token is justified

Create one only when:

- existing Semantic roles cannot express the value clearly;
- the meaning is stable and owned by that component;
- the role recurs across variants, states, or implementations;
- the extra layer reduces real implementation or theming complexity;
- the contract can be mapped consistently in Figma and code;
- the Design System owner approves it.

Do not create Component Color tokens for one-off values, experiments, every Figma property/state, or aliases that only rename Semantic Color.

## Approved Color exception: Tag

Tag owns a private categorical Color contract because its hues communicate grouping/categorization rather than shared system semantics such as Success, Warning, or Error.

Canonical component contract:

```text
tag/{color}/surface
tag/{color}/surface-hover
tag/{color}/fg
tag/{color}/line
```

Current canonical colors:

```text
neutral
brand
blue
teal
green
yellow
orange
red
magenta
purple
```

This set is intentionally not a complete hue palette. Cyan and Warm Gray remain legacy-only.

### Theme extension model

Tag is a **sparse Component Theme Extension**.

Ownership is split intentionally:

```text
Tag / Design System
→ owns token names + meaning

Theme package
→ provides values for those Tag contracts

Tag implementation
→ consumes tag/*

Product code
→ must not consume tag/*
```

The Theme does not own Tag anatomy and must not invent Tag token names. It only implements the stable Tag contract declared by the component.

For v1, Tag extension values may ship inside the same physical Theme package as Semantic Color. A separate package or entry point is **not required** merely because the logical contract is component-specific.

Conceptually:

```text
@theme-jobvision
├── color primitives
├── semantic color values
└── component extensions
    └── tag values

@theme-cando
├── color primitives
├── semantic color values
└── component extensions
    └── tag values
```

Physical packaging may be split later for payload/build reasons without changing ownership or token identity.

### Consumption boundary

Tag tokens are component-implementation API, not Product-facing Design System API.

Product tooling should therefore:

- omit `tag/*` from general Semantic token registries/autocomplete;
- not generate public Tailwind utilities for `tag/*`;
- reject direct `tag/*` use in ordinary Product code where lint/CI can enforce it;
- allow the Tag implementation to consume the contract.

If CSS custom properties for Tag are emitted globally, physical CSS visibility does not make them public API.

### Resolution rules

- `neutral` resolves from Theme values chosen for neutral categorization.
- `brand` varies by Theme: JobVision resolves from its Brand hue; Cando resolves from its Brand hue.
- other categorical hues resolve from the Theme's appropriate categorical/Primitive values;
- do not map categorical Green to Success, Yellow to Warning, Red to Error, or Purple to Magic merely because the hues match;
- equivalent Tag roles across hues do not need identical numeric Primitive steps when contrast/appearance requires otherwise.

The current four Tag roles are retained for every canonical color. `surface-hover` is consumed only when the rendered Tag is interactive.

### Promotion rule

Do not create a shared `categorical/*` API while Tag is the only real consumer.

If the same categorization meaning later becomes a stable cross-component need—for example across Tag, Legend, Category Badge, and other reviewed components—evaluate promotion from `tag/*` into a shared categorical contract at that time.

Abstract after repeated cross-component need, not before it.

## Applied Filter rule

Do not use Tag tokens merely because an applied Filter Chip visually resembles a Tag.

Use this order:

1. Express the state with existing Semantic roles, such as `surface/accent-muted*` when appropriate.
2. If a stable component-owned treatment still cannot be expressed, introduce a reviewed component-specific contract.
3. Reuse Tag tokens only when the UI is actually rendering the Tag component.

## Naming

Canonical Tag naming follows:

```text
{component}/{variant}/{role-or-state}
```

Examples:

```text
tag/blue/surface
tag/blue/surface-hover
tag/blue/fg
tag/blue/line
```

Runtime/CSS flattening is a separate implementation decision.

## Review checklist

- Can an existing Semantic token express this value?
- Does the token add stable component meaning?
- Is it reused enough to justify another layer?
- Does it reduce real branching or duplication?
- Is the name independent from an accidental visual value, except where hue itself is the approved categorical contract?
- Is the mapping valid across supported Theme × Appearance contexts?
