# Breadcrumb

## Purpose

Breadcrumb shows the current page in its hierarchical context and lets users navigate to ancestor destinations.

Use it when the page belongs to a meaningful multi-level hierarchy. Do not use it as a replacement for primary navigation, tabs, step/progress navigation, or browser history.

## Canonical Figma Model

Canonical file: `[DS] Job Vision NEXT`

### Breadcrumb

- Component: `Breadcrumb`
- Figma node ID: `22973:282463`
- Figma component key: `b0fb38288d8b84e0ff6e1d5ded6eeb31574581fa`
- Content property: native `Items` SLOT
- Default authoring content: 3 visible items
- Slot preferred content: `Breadcrumb Item / Default`
- Slot minimum: 2 items
- Default content remains visible when a new Breadcrumb instance is inserted.

### Breadcrumb Item

- Component set: `Breadcrumb Item / Default`
- Figma node ID: `22986:407`
- Figma component key: `e0fcea8c52b6deb183c6d2c4624243875ae21425`
- Variant property: `Type = Link / Current / Overflow`
- Content property: `Current label`

The set is intentionally small. Link and Overflow interaction states are owned by their nested canonical components rather than duplicated as Breadcrumb variants.

## Anatomy and Composition

A Breadcrumb contains:

1. one current-page item;
2. zero or more ancestor Link items;
3. an optional Overflow item when middle hierarchy levels are collapsed.

### Link item

`Type=Link` composes the canonical `Link / Default` component at:

- Style: `Subtle`
- Size: `Medium`

Link text and interaction states remain owned by Link.

Do not add Breadcrumb-specific Hover, Active, Focus, Disabled, or Visited states.

### Current item

The current page:

- is always present;
- is the last semantic hierarchy item;
- is non-interactive;
- uses the primary foreground treatment;
- must be identifiable as the current page to assistive technology.

Do not render the current page as another ancestor Link.

### Overflow item

`Type=Overflow` composes the canonical `Icon Button / Ghost / Extra Small`.

It represents hidden middle hierarchy levels. The overflow surface/menu implementation is a runtime dependency and is not duplicated as a Breadcrumb variant.

### Separator

The visual separator is `/` using the secondary foreground treatment.

Separators are presentation only and must not become meaningful screen-reader content.

Current has no trailing separator.

## Spacing and Sizing

The reviewed Figma composition uses:

- Breadcrumb Items Slot gap: `8px`;
- Link item separator-to-Link gap: `8px`;
- Overflow separator-to-trigger gap: `4px`;
- minimum stable Breadcrumb height: `28px`, driven by the Extra Small overflow Icon Button.

Breadcrumb remains single-line.

Do not introduce a wrapping Breadcrumb layout as a second shared variant.

## Hierarchy and Overflow

For short paths, show the complete useful hierarchy.

For deep or constrained paths, preserve the most useful context with the reviewed pattern:

```text
Root / … / Parent / Current
```

Rules:

- Current is always visible.
- The nearest Parent is preserved.
- Root remains a normal text Link by default; do not replace it with a home-icon-only convention.
- Overflow represents hidden middle levels.
- There is no fixed maximum item-count contract.
- The exact runtime measurement threshold and collapse algorithm remain unverified until the owning runtime source is registered.

Primer and Carbon both support an overflow model for constrained/deep Breadcrumbs; the JV contract keeps a visible Root, nearest Parent, and Current in the reviewed collapsed state.

## Long Labels and Responsive Behavior

Breadcrumb stays on one line.

Long labels truncate rather than wrap.

Figma authoring currently demonstrates:

- ancestor Link label cap: approximately `220px`;
- Current label cap: approximately `240px`.

These values are Figma authoring constraints, not a verified runtime API or breakpoint contract.

At runtime, available inline space should drive truncation/collapse. Do not infer a fixed viewport breakpoint from the Figma examples.

For increasingly narrow layouts, collapse hierarchy before allowing the Breadcrumb to become a multiline block.

## RTL and Direction

Do not create separate RTL variants.

The hierarchy remains semantic; visual layout follows the document direction.

In RTL product authoring:

- Current appears at the logical end of the path;
- ancestors extend toward the logical start;
- Link and Icon Button behavior follows their own RTL contracts.

The slash separator does not require a mirrored asset.

Runtime DOM/order must preserve understandable hierarchy for assistive technology rather than relying only on visual reversal.

## Accessibility Contract

Breadcrumb follows standard breadcrumb navigation semantics:

- expose the trail as a navigation landmark with an accessible label;
- represent hierarchy as an ordered list or equivalent semantic list structure;
- ancestor destinations are normal Links;
- identify the current page with `aria-current="page"` or the equivalent current-page semantic on the non-interactive current item;
- keep visual separators out of the accessibility tree;
- do not create custom keyboard navigation for the trail itself;
- ancestor Links use normal Link keyboard/focus behavior;
- the Overflow trigger uses normal Icon Button focus behavior and must have an accessible name;
- hidden hierarchy levels exposed through Overflow must remain keyboard-accessible through the owning popup/menu pattern;
- Breadcrumb wrappers must not clip Link or Icon Button focus outlines.

The WAI-ARIA APG Breadcrumb pattern uses a labeled navigation landmark and ordered-list structure. Carbon similarly treats the current page as non-link content and keeps a truncation/overflow trigger in the keyboard sequence.

## Figma Authoring Rules

- Insert `Breadcrumb` for the full path; do not assemble unrelated Link instances manually.
- Use `Breadcrumb Item / Default` inside the native Items Slot.
- Include exactly one `Type=Current`.
- Use `Type=Link` for ancestors.
- Use `Type=Overflow` only when levels are intentionally collapsed.
- Do not detach Link or Icon Button to create Breadcrumb-specific states.
- Do not use `Breadcrumb / Legacy` or `Breadcrumb Item / Legacy` for new work.

## Runtime Boundary

The owning JV Design System runtime repository/package is not registered in Design System Knowledge.

The verified Storybook source is also not registered.

Therefore the following remain explicitly unverified:

- exact runtime component/API name;
- exact props/inputs/outputs;
- DOM implementation details beyond the semantic contract above;
- exact collapse measurement/algorithm;
- popup/menu implementation used by Overflow;
- exact framework/Tailwind implementation;
- Storybook story/docs identifier;
- Figma-property to code-prop mapping;
- Code Connect mapping.

Do not infer these from Figma property names.

## QA Checklist

Verify:

- a newly inserted Breadcrumb shows visible default content;
- exactly one Current item exists;
- Current is non-interactive;
- ancestor items compose canonical Subtle / Medium Link;
- Overflow composes canonical Ghost / Extra Small Icon Button;
- short paths render without unnecessary Overflow;
- deep paths can represent Root / Overflow / Parent / Current;
- long labels stay single-line and truncate;
- RTL hierarchy is visually correct;
- Link and Overflow Focus treatments remain visible and unclipped;
- separators are decorative for assistive technology;
- runtime current-page semantics are present when implementation is registered.

## Legacy

Legacy Figma components remain separated from the canonical documentation area only for migration/reference:

- `Breadcrumb / Legacy`
- `Breadcrumb Item / Legacy`

Do not create new instances from legacy components.
