# Rich Text Editor

## Purpose

Rich Text Editor captures multiline content that requires inline or paragraph-level formatting.

It is a separate public component from Textarea. Use Textarea when plain multiline text is sufficient. Rich Text Editor owns a formatting toolbar and richer editing semantics that require a dedicated editor implementation.

Both components share the same Field contract for Label, Required, Info, supporting content, validation, RTL treatment, semantic colors, resizing, and focus/error composition.

## Canonical Figma Contract

Component set: `Rich Text Editor`

Figma node: `22866:134455` in `-DS--Job-Vision-NEXT`.

### Variant axes

| Property | Values |
|---|---|
| `State` | `Default`, `Hover`, `Focus`, `Error`, `Error focus`, `Disabled` |
| `Toolbar` | `Compact`, `Expanded` |
| `Supporting` | `Hidden`, `Visible` |

Default: `State=Default, Toolbar=Compact, Supporting=Hidden`.

The public matrix contains 24 variants.

### Top-level authoring properties

| Property | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `Show label` | Shows/hides the shared Field label row |
| `Filled` | Figma-only content condition; False shows Placeholder, True shows Value |
| `Placeholder` | Placeholder copy |
| `Value` | Plain sample value used for Figma authoring |
| `Resizable` | Shows/hides the shared resize handle |

`Filled` is an authoring convenience in Figma, not a runtime interaction state or required code prop.

`Value` is only a visual representation of editor content in Figma. It does not define the runtime rich-text data model, HTML, JSON, Markdown, marks, links, or document schema.

### Contextual nested properties

`Field label` exposes the shared:

- `Label`
- `Required`
- `Show info`

Supporting content follows the Textarea pattern:

- non-error + `Supporting=Hidden` → the shared Supporting instance remains in the anatomy but is hidden;
- non-error + `Supporting=Visible` → Helper/Count row is visible;
- `Error` and `Error focus` → Error content is always retained; Count may also be shown.

Keeping the same nested Supporting instance across variants is required so helper/count overrides survive variant switching.

## Anatomy

```text
Rich Text Editor
├── Field
│   ├── Field label
│   └── Editor
│       ├── Rich Text Toolbar
│       ├── Divider
│       ├── Editable area
│       │   ├── Placeholder
│       │   ├── Value overlay
│       │   └── Resize handle
│       ├── Border
│       └── Focus ring
└── Supporting content
    ├── Helper / Count
    └── Error / Count
```

Focus and validation styling belong to the complete Editor shell, not only the editable area.

## Geometry

Default width: `288px`.

This intentionally matches the canonical Textarea baseline instead of introducing a wider Rich Text-only default.

Shared editor geometry:

- radius → `6px`
- editable-area padding → `16px`
- editable-area typography → shared Textarea body style, currently Vazirmatn Regular `14/20`
- toolbar/body divider → `1px`
- editable-area minimum height → `120px`

### Compact toolbar

```text
40 toolbar
+ 1 divider
+ 120 editable area
= 161px Editor shell
```

With visible Label and no visible supporting row, the outer field height is `185px`.

### Expanded toolbar

```text
81 toolbar
+ 1 divider
+ 120 editable area
= 202px Editor shell
```

With visible Label and no visible supporting row, the outer field height is `226px`.

A visible supporting row adds `20px` to the outer geometry.

### Resizing

The Figma instance may be resized horizontally and vertically.

On vertical growth:

- Label height remains fixed;
- Toolbar height remains fixed;
- Supporting height remains fixed;
- Editable area absorbs the additional height.

On horizontal growth:

- Toolbar stretches;
- Editable area stretches;
- Value overlay stays inset by the 16px body padding;
- Supporting content stretches;
- Border and focus indicator stretch.

Real-instance QA has been run at `480px` width and increased vertical height.

## State Model

### Default

- Editor surface → `surface/default`
- line → `line/default`, 1px
- Value → `fg/primary`
- Placeholder → `fg/placeholder`

### Hover

- line → `line/emphasis`, 1px

### Focus

```text
Editor line → line/emphasis, 1px
Focus indicator → focus/default, 2px outside
```

### Error

```text
Editor line → line/error, 2px
Error message → fg/error
Programmatic invalid state → required in implementation
```

The 2px Error line is overlay geometry and must not shift content.

### Error focus

Error meaning and keyboard focus remain independently visible:

```text
Editor line → line/error, 2px
Focus indicator → focus/default, 2px outside
Error message → fg/error
```

### Disabled

Disabled applies to the complete field:

- Editor surface → `surface/disabled`
- line → `line/disabled`
- Value / Placeholder → `fg/disabled`
- Label / Supporting / resize handle → disabled foreground treatment
- Toolbar controls → disabled
- Toolbar dividers → `line/disabled`

## Internal Rich Text Toolbar

Canonical internal component set: `_Rich Text Toolbar`

Figma node: `22865:3861`.

The toolbar is intentionally internal. It is part of the Rich Text Editor contract, not a general-purpose standalone Toolbar component.

### Toolbar axes

| Property | Values |
|---|---|
| `Layout` | `Compact`, `Expanded` |
| `State` | `Enabled`, `Disabled` |

The toolbar has four variants.

### Compact

Compact is one `40px` row and is designed to fit the canonical `288px` editor width.

RTL visual order from the starting edge:

```text
Character formatting
→ Lists
→ Link
→ Overflow
```

Controls:

- Bold
- Italic
- Underline
- Strikethrough
- Bulleted list
- Numbered list
- Link
- Overflow

### Expanded

Expanded adds a second `40px` row separated by a `1px` divider.

The second row contains:

- Align right
- Align center
- Align left
- Align justify
- RTL text direction
- LTR text direction
- Undo
- Redo

Expanded toolbar height: `81px`.

The RTL-first default presentation shows Align right and RTL direction as selected.

## Formatting Selection vs Interaction

Persistent formatting selection must not use Icon Button `Active`.

Icon Button `Active` is a transient interaction state. Rich-text formatting such as Bold, list type, alignment, and text direction is persistent selection/current-value state.

The internal component `_Rich Text Toolbar Toggle` owns this distinction.

Figma node: `22864:3503`.

### Toggle axes

| Property | Values |
|---|---|
| `Selected` | `False`, `True` |
| `State` | `Enabled`, `Hover`, `Active`, `Focus`, `Disabled` |

Selected treatment uses the existing selection surface tokens. Interaction states remain independent.

Examples:

- Bold selected when the caret/selection is in bold text;
- Bulleted list selected when the current block uses that list type;
- Align right selected for the current paragraph;
- RTL selected for the current paragraph/selection.

Do not create toolbar-level variants for combinations of formatting values.

Undo, Redo, and Overflow remain normal action Icon Buttons rather than selected toggles.

## Icons

Rich-text formatting icons are canonical general-DS icons on the `Icons` page, not private 16px assets owned by Rich Text Editor.

They follow the existing `24×24` icon component convention and are consumed through Icon Button / Toolbar Toggle icon slots.

The archived first draft contains old local 16px icon assets only to avoid breaking archived instances. Do not reuse those assets.

## Intentionally Excluded from Shared v1

The old CanDo toolbar included controls that are not part of the shared v1 contract:

- Add Token / Parameter;
- Font family;
- raw pixel Font size.

Add Token is product-specific behavior.

Font family should not bypass the product typography/theme contract.

Raw Font size should not be exposed until a shared semantic rich-text typography model exists, for example Paragraph / Heading styles.

Indentation may be added later if a real shared product requirement is validated.

## RTL

The component is RTL-first for current JobVision / CanDo products.

Toolbar group order is anchored to the RTL starting edge. Text direction is a content-formatting action; it does not flip the Design System component layout itself.

Mixed-direction content must not change the structural meaning or placement of toolbar groups.

## Behavior Boundary

The Design System owns:

- Editor shell anatomy;
- shared Field integration;
- toolbar grouping and visual hierarchy;
- persistent selected vs transient interaction semantics;
- focus/error/disabled visuals;
- default/minimum geometry and resizing;
- semantic token usage;
- formatting-action affordances.

The consuming editor implementation owns or must define:

- editor framework;
- runtime rich-text document model;
- selection and caret behavior;
- command execution;
- keyboard shortcuts;
- paste/sanitization behavior;
- output/serialization format;
- undo/redo history semantics;
- link editing UI/behavior;
- semantic paragraph/heading model if introduced.

Do not infer a specific runtime editor framework from Figma.

## Accessibility

Rich Text Editor is not a native Textarea and requires an explicit implementation contract.

### Editable region

Implementation must preserve:

- accessible labeling;
- keyboard text editing;
- selection/caret access;
- screen-reader-compatible editing semantics;
- invalid/disabled relationships as applicable.

### Toolbar

Every toolbar control requires:

- an accessible name independent of its icon;
- keyboard operability;
- exposed pressed/selected state for persistent formatting toggles;
- visible focus;
- predictable focus movement;
- selection preservation when a toolbar action is executed.

Undo/Redo and other unavailable actions must expose disabled state when applicable.

### Focus

Visible focus must remain clear for both:

- the Editor/editable region;
- an individual toolbar control during keyboard navigation.

Editor-shell focus does not replace button-level focus.

### Error

Error requires:

- textual Error content;
- programmatic invalid state or equivalent editor semantics;
- visible Error styling;
- independent visible Focus when focused.

## QA Checklist

Verify:

- exactly 24 public variants exist;
- default is Default / Compact / Hidden;
- public authoring properties are Show label / Filled / Placeholder / Value / Resizable;
- default width is 288px;
- editable-area minimum height is 120px;
- body padding is 16px;
- Compact toolbar is 40px and fits 288px;
- Expanded toolbar is 81px;
- Filled preserves Placeholder and Value independently;
- Compact ↔ Expanded preserves Value and supporting overrides;
- Supporting Hidden ↔ Visible preserves Helper / Count overrides;
- Error always retains textual Error content;
- Error focus preserves Error + Focus simultaneously;
- Disabled applies to editor, toolbar, label, supporting content, and resize handle;
- persistent formatting uses Selected semantics, not Icon Button Active;
- horizontal resizing stretches toolbar/body/support/border/focus;
- vertical resizing grows only the editable area;
- Resizable controls only resize-handle visibility;
- hiding the visual label requires another accessible-name mechanism in implementation;
- RTL toolbar order remains correct.

## Runtime / Storybook Status

No runtime editor package or Storybook implementation is currently registered as canonical for Rich Text Editor.

Do not infer:

- Angular API;
- DOM/contenteditable structure;
- editor framework;
- serialization format;
- command API;
- keyboard-shortcut implementation.

## Open Items

Before the runtime contract is finalized:

- select/register the canonical editor implementation;
- define the rich-text value/output model;
- define toolbar keyboard navigation and selection-preservation behavior;
- define Link editing behavior;
- define semantic Paragraph/Heading styles before adding typography controls;
- decide whether indentation is shared;
- define paste/sanitization rules;
- define a first-class Read only contract if a real product use case requires it;
- register Storybook and browser accessibility tests.

Read only is intentionally not a Figma state yet because Rich Text Editor needs an explicit behavior decision for the toolbar and editable region rather than inheriting Textarea semantics blindly.

These open items do not block the current visual/Figma-authoring contract.
