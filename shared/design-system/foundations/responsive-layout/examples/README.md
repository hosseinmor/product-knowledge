# Responsive Layout Examples

> Status: Scaffold — no product example has been validated and added yet.

This directory is reserved for reviewed examples from real Jobvision and Cando product behavior. Examples must not invent product rules or present Figma-only behavior as implemented behavior.

## Suggested files

```text
ats-job-page.md
employer-resume-list.md
job-search-results.md
```

Create an example only when it adds reusable evidence beyond the general guideline.

## Example template

```md

Before an example becomes reviewed:

- identify the relevant product owner or Design System owner;
- verify behavior at both sides of the threshold;
- verify RTL and content expansion;
- document known deviations from the shared responsive specification.
