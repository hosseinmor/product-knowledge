# Ownership

## Purpose

Keep canonical Design System knowledge reviewable and maintainable without tying repository structure to team structure.

## Roles

### Design System team

The Design System team is the canonical owner of shared Design System foundations, tokens, components, patterns, governance, and accessibility guidance unless a document explicitly names another owner.

For the operational accessibility corpus, the Design System team owns standards interpretation, cross-document consistency, routing integrity, and approval of canonical changes.

### Product and feature owners

Product teams own product-specific composition, flow policy, business rules, copy, and implementation decisions that use the Design System. A product flow such as Apply + Screening Questions requires a Product/Pattern owner; specialized accessibility documents do not become the owner of product-specific behavior.

### Contributors and reviewers

Designers, engineers, QA, AI agents, and accessibility reviewers may propose changes and evidence. Canonical approval remains with the named owner.

## Process

- Canonical/reviewed Design System documents **SHOULD** resolve to an owner.
- The 18 operational documents in `shared/design-system/accessibility/` inherit `Design System team` as their collection owner unless a document explicitly names another approved owner.
- The retrieval manifest **MUST** resolve that inherited owner so accessibility documents do not appear ownerless to AI or maintenance tooling.
- Individual accessibility documents MAY repeat the inherited owner in frontmatter when useful; omission does not mean ownership is unknown.
- Changing the collection owner or adding a document-specific override is a governance change and requires owner review through a branch and pull request.
- An unresolved owner outside a defined collection default does not make a document invalid for retrieval, but it is a maintenance gap that must be resolved before the document is treated as operationally complete.

## Review Requirements

Owner review is required when a change:
- changes normative Design System behavior;
- changes accessibility requirement levels or standards interpretation;
- changes component/pattern maturity used by AI retrieval;
- changes routing, ownership, deprecation, or release policy.

## Definition of Done

A canonical Design System knowledge change is ownership-ready when:
- the owning document or collection default is clear;
- the manifest resolves the effective owner where required;
- unresolved decisions remain explicit;
- repository validation passes;
- required domain-specific regression gates pass.
