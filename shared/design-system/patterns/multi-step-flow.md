# Multi-Step Flow

## Intermediate Steps

Default combination:

- Forward action → Primary
- Back action → Ghost

Example:

```text
[Continue]  Back
```

Do not use Brand for every forward action. Intermediate progression is normally an operational action and remains Primary.

## Final Step

The final Button label must describe the result rather than repeat “Continue.”

Examples:

- Submit request
- Create job
- Send for approval
- Pay
- Submit resume

Preset selection:

- Operational result → Primary
- Approved product conversion / product-defining result → Brand
- Destructive result → Danger Filled

Being the final step does not automatically make an action Brand. Brand is only used when the result belongs to the approved product conversion/product-moment contract.

## Back, Cancel, Close, and Exit

| Action | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Back | Move to the previous step without leaving the flow |
| Cancel | Cancel the current operation |
| Close | Close the current surface |
| Exit | Leave the entire flow |

When Close or Exit causes data loss, show a confirmation. Button styling alone is not sufficient to communicate the risk.

## RTL Placement

- Place the forward or main action on the right side of the action group.
- Place Back, Cancel, or an alternative after it, toward the left.
- A third or exit action may be separated from the main group.

## Mobile

- The main action may become full width.
- Place the secondary action below it.
- Preserve visual hierarchy after stacking.

## Submission State

When the current step is submitting:

- The triggered Button enters Loading.
- Repeated submission is blocked.
- Back and competing actions are disabled until the request completes.
